        <h1>Introduction:</h1>

        <p>This guide covers the basics of 3D printing with the Monoprice Maker Ultimate. I’m assuming that 
            you’ve already read through the Maker Ultimate User Manual and that your printer is already 
            assembled. I am using a Mac, so if you’re on a Windows system, the software may look different. 
            However, I’ve made sure to include Windows-specific instructions for important steps. That being said, 
            let’s jump into 3D printing!

        <h1>Leveling the buildplate:</h1>
        <p> To start leveling, turn on your printer and select Maintenance > Buildplate, then follow the steps on the 
        LED screen. 
        <br><br>
        I used a digital caliper to take measurements. For the nozzle to be 1 mm from the buildplate, the top of 
        the nozzle should be 20 mm from the top of the buildplate and 26.5 mm from the underside edges of the 
        buildplate.

            <li>An SD Card</li>

        </div>

        <p>Once you’ve decided on a model, download it and unzip it, taking note of where the files are saved.</p>
        
        <h2>Import model</h2>
        <p>Open Ultimaker Cura and import your model. There are several ways to do this:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>click the <img src="imgs/folder_symbol.png" class="symbol"> icon and select your file</li>
            <li>Click File > Open File(s) (or press ⌘  + O on mac, CTRL + O on windows) from the ribbon and select 
                your file</li>
            <li>Drag and drop your file into Ultimaker Cura</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h2>Prepare model for printing:</h2>
        
        <h3>Position model</h3>
        <p>You can move your model by clicking and dragging or by manually entering the position coordinates. 
            Additionally, you can rotate, rescale, and mirror your model using the positioning tools on the left side 
            of the window.</p>
        
        <h3>Set print options:</h3>
        <img src="imgs/basic_settings.png" alt="Ultimaker Cura basic settings" title="Basic Settings" class="large">
        <p>For some prints, it may be necessary to play with the print settings. Here is a list of the basic settings 
            and what they do.</p>
        
        <div class="table">
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Setting</th>
                <th>Description</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Layer Height</td>
                <td>Affects the speed, detail, and smoothness of a print. A larger layer height results in a faster, 
                    less detailed, rougher print and a smaller layer height results in a slower, more detailed, 
                    smoother print.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Infill</td>
                <td>Changes density of print. A higher infill can take longer, but increases the structural 
                    integrity of a print. A lower infill can be faster but makes a print more brittle.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Gradual Infill</td>
                <td>Increases infill during print. Can increase print speed. Select this option if detail isn’t 
                    important near the bottom of the print.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Support Structures</td>
                <td>Generates small, removable structures in areas with overhang. Select this if your print has 
                    large areas with overhang. You can also choose certain areas to print without support structures 
                    using the “block supports” tool.</td>
            </tr> 
            <tr>
                <td>Adhesion</td>
                <td>Generates small, removable platform underneath print. Prevents print from falling over mid-print.</td>
            </tr>     
        </table>
        </div>

        <h4>Advanced Print Settings</h4>
        <img src="imgs/advanced_settings.png" alt="Ultimkaer Cura advanced settings" title="Advanced Settings" class="large">
        <p>Cura includes some more advanced settings. For a detailed guide to each of these settings, visit 
            <a href="https://ultimaker.com/en/resources/52835-quality">this site</a>.</p>
        
        <h2>Save to SD Card:</h2>
        <p>If you haven’t already inserted your SD card, do it now. Click the slice button. Wait for the program to 
            generate the .gcode file, then click the “Save to Removable Drive” button. Then, click the “Eject” button and 
            remove the SD card.</p>
        
        <h2>Printing Model</h2>
        <p>Insert your SD card into the printer. Select Print > Your_Model_Name. The print should begin. I recommend 
            watching your print for the first couple layers to make sure your model is printing correctly. If you notice 
            printing errors, you can change settings in Cura, or tweak your print settings in the “Tune” menu on the 
            printer.</p>
        
        <h2>Removing and cleaning model</h2>
        <p>Once your print has finished, it can be removed from the print bed with a spatula. If it takes more than gentle
            force to remove print, it can help to heat up the print bed. Select Maintenance > Advanced > Heatup buildplate.
            Set the temperature to 60˚ C. Increase if necessary. If you printed with supports, you can remove them now 
            using a craft knife or by just breaking them with your hands.</p>

    <div id="Troubleshooting">
        <h1>Troubleshooting:</h1>
        <p>Often times, prints can turn out lower-than-expected quality or can fail to print entirely. When this happens,
            I find a good first step is to Google your issue. Usually, other people have run into the same issue and
            shared their solution. Additionally, I have included a log of the issues I have experienced and the steps I 
            took to solve the problem. </p>
